We will use for loops to save plots of our data at every single date in our time variable. 

#### Objectives

1. Python has a cool tool for creating strings with variable values. For example, if I want to print out a string that contains someone's name and age, I can write `"My name is {} and I am {} years old".format('Katy', 24)`. The great part about this is that we can change the input to be anything, without having to rewrite the entire string or add strings together.

  Read more about the [str.format function here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-format-function/). With your partner, practice writing a string that takes in (a) one variable input, (b) two variables inputs, (c) three variable inputs, and (d) two variable inputs that have an order  (see Code #4 in the link). 
  
2. Write a for loop that loops over the names of your fellow interns and prints out "_______ is a intern in Ocean's Six" (replacing the ____ with an intern's name).

3. Applying what you have now learned about str.format and for loops, write a for loop that plots sea level anomaly data for each date in the dataset (adding x labels, y labels, and a colorbar), gives the plot a title with the date in it, and saves the plot with a name that has a unique date-identifier in it (otherwise we will be resaving over the same image!)
