# Dataset visualization | 12-11-18

## Set up
- Open your netCDF.py script in Atom

## Tasks
1. Load your dataset. This command should already be written into your script. 

2. Take a look at the numpy arrays corresponding to each dimension variable (there are three!). Try to assign each array to a new, descriptive variable name (like `lat`). 

Do the same for our data variable.

3. We're going to make a pixel plot of our data, using Matplotlib's very simple [`pcolor` function](https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.pcolor.html).

     - First, you'll need to figure out what new library to import. Take a look at [this demo](https://matplotlib.org/examples/pylab_examples/pcolor_demo.html) and see if you can figure out the correct import statement. Go ahead and add it to the top of your script. 
     - Using these two tutorials, and Google, use the `pcolor` function to plot a day's worth of sea level anomaly as a function of latitude and longitude.
