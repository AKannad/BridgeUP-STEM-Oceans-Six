# Project 1: Plotting ocean eddies
### Team members: Thalia and Liliann

### Mission: Write a script that plots eddies on a map of sea level anomaly.

You'll start with a dataframe containing contour paths and levels (this is the output of our eddy identification algorithm that you have already created). Given this dataframe of contour lines, can you plot the lines on top of a map of sea level anomaly? You may need for loops and Matplotlib.

Your output should look kind of like this, but you're welcome to be as creative as you want! ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amnh/BridgeUP-STEM-Oceans-Six/master/photos/SLA_with_contours.png?token=AmUbDnSOQ0VJNj8F7JVAFOKbDs_HY-xsks5cv3BvwA%3D%3D)

Ultimately, you'll be combining this script with your fellow interns' work on the other projects, so make sure it can be easily adapted to others' code.

Optional reach tasks:
1) Color code the eddies by whether they are cyclonic or anticyclonic! We tend to color anticyclonic eddies in red and cyclonic in blue.

2) Develop the code to make this into a video, if time.
