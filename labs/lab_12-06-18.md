# Dataset dimensions | 12-06-18

## Set up
- Open your netCDF.py script in Atom

## Tasks
1. Access the variables in your dataset. (i.e., load in your dataset with the Dataset tool, and use `dataset.variables`)

2. Take a look at the numpy arrays corresponding to each dimension variable (there are three!). Try to assign each array to a new, descriptive variable name (like `lat`)

3. Try to draw/visualize the three dimensions on a piece of paper. This is your chance to be creative! Think about what the values in each numpy array represent. What are the units? What is the shape of each numpy array? Is it 1D or 2D? 
You may work with a partner, but each person should come up with their own drawing.

If you finish drawing, you can also add in labels that correspond to the values in the numpy array (for example, label the degrees of latitude).
